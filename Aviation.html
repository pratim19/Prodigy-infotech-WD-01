            <p>Aeroplanes, also known as airplanes or aircraft, are vehicles that are capable of flight. An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or, in a few cases, direct downward thrust from its engines. Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons. They are designed for various purposes, including transportation of passengers and cargo, military operations, and recreational flying.</p>
            <p>The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. The science of aviation, including designing and building aircraft, is called aeronautics. Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, whereas unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, aircraft propulsion (if any), usage and others.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The history of aviation is a fascinating journey that spans over two thousand years, from the earliest forms of flight to the advanced aircraft we see today.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Ancient Times: </b>The earliest form of man-made flight was kite flying, which originated in China several hundred years BC.</li>
              <li><b>15th Century: </b>Leonardo da Vinci’s dream of flight was expressed in several designs, although they were based on then-limited scientific understanding.</li>
              <li><b>Late 18th Century: </b>The Montgolfier brothers invented the hot-air balloon, marking the beginning of manned flights. Around the same time, the discovery of hydrogen gas led to the invention of the hydrogen balloon.</li>
              <li><b>Early 20th Century: </b>The Wright Brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, made significant contributions to aviation. They are credited with inventing, building, and flying the world’s first successful airplane.</li>
              <li><b>Post World War II: </b>After World War II, the flying boats were replaced by land planes, and the new and immensely powerful jet engine revolutionised both air travel and military aviation.</li>
              <li><b>21st Century: </b>The 21st century saw the large-scale use of pilotless drones for military, civilian and leisure use. With digital controls, inherently unstable aircraft such as flying wings became possible.</li>

                <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden; transition: max-height 0.3s ease-out;">
                    <p>A: The fastest unmanned aircraft in the world is the <b>NASA X-43</b> which hit Mach 9.6 (nearly 10 times the speed of sound) on November 16, 2004 at an altitude of 33,223 meters over the Pacific Ocean. If you’re talking about manned flights, the <b>NASA X-15</b> with its Mach 6.72 speed is still king of the hill. Both the X-15 and the X-43A are experimental aircrafts.</p>
                    <p>The <b>Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird</b> holds the speed record for the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft, reaching a maximum speed of 2,200 mph (Mach 3.3), which has actually been put to use outside gathering experimental data. <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/40624/fastest-jet-in-the-world/" target="_blank">Reference!</a></p>
                    <p>When considering operational aircraft used for regular missions, the fastest jets are typically military fighters like the <b>F-22 Raptor</b> or the <b>MiG-31</b>, which can reach speeds exceeding Mach 2.</p>
                    <p>In terms of the fastest aircraft ever to carry passengers, the <b>Concorde</b> is undoubtedly the victor here. The Concorde could cruise at a maximum of Mach 2.04 (1,354 mph / 2,455 kph) and was the only commercial aircraft to break the sound barrier.</p>

                <h3>Q: How do airplanes fly?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden; transition: max-height 0.3s ease-out;">
                    <p>A: Airplanes fly using the principles of aerodynamics, which involve generating lift through the wings' shape and propulsion provided by engines. They fly by balancing four forces: lift, weight (or gravity), thrust, and drag.</p>
                    <p><b>Lift: </b>This is the upward force that is created as air flows over and under the wings of an airplane. The wings are designed in a specific shape - flat at the bottom and curved at the top. This shape causes the air on top of the wing to move faster than the air underneath, creating a pressure difference. The higher pressure underneath the wing, compared to the lower pressure on top, creates lift.</p>
                    <p><b>Weight (or Gravity): </b>This is the force that pulls the airplane down due to its mass and the earth’s gravity. For an airplane to stay in the air, the lift must be equal to or greater than the weight.</p>
                    <p><b>Thrust: </b>This is the forward force that propels the airplane through the air. It is produced by the airplane’s engines, which can be either jet engines or propellers.</p>
                    <p><b>Drag: </b>This is the resistance or friction that air exerts against the airplane as it moves through the sky. To continue moving forward, the airplane must produce enough thrust to overcome this drag.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: 0; overflow: hidden; transition: max-height 0.3s ease-out;">
                    <p>A: Mach speed is the speed of an object moving through air, or any other fluid substance, divided by the speed of sound as it is in that substance. <b>Sound travels at a speed of 343 m/s or 1235 km/hr or 767 miles/hour, otherwise known as Mach 1.0. </b>As the Mach number increases, the speed of sound is reached and surpassed. <b>Mach 1 is the speed of sound</b>, Mach 2 is twice the speed of sound, and so on. When aircraft travel faster than the speed of sound, they break what is known as the ‘sound barrier’ that can often result in a sonic boom.</p>
